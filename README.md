# 🌍 World Bank ETL Project

This project implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline to retrieve, process, and store data from the **World Bank Open Data** platform.  
The main goal is to automate the ingestion of global socioeconomic information, standardize it, and prepare it for further analysis.

## 🚀 Project Goals
- **Extract:** download datasets from the World Bank API or official repositories.  
- **Transform:** clean, normalize, and enrich the data (formatting, type casting, derived metrics, removal of nulls/duplicates).  
- **Load:** store the processed data into a chosen storage system (e.g., database, data warehouse, or optimized files like Parquet/CSV).
